<blockquote>
<p>Barriers to women in science remain widely spread worldwide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Main takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the most productive countries, papers with women in dominent author positions, i.e., sole author, first author, and last author, are cited less than those with men in the same positions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>South America and Eastern Europe had greater gender parity in terms of proportion of authorships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disciplines dominated by women all have to do with &ldquo;care&rdquo;, for example, nursing; speech, language, and hearing; education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Natural sciences and humanities are dominated by men. Social sciences had a higher proportion of femail authors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Female collaborations are more domestically oriented than are the collaborations of males from the same country&rdquo;  (p. 213)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My issue: How did the authors assign gender to each author? It seems to me that it&rsquo;s a very difficult job, especially when the names are of a non-Western origin.</p>

<p>Major takeaway: Big data research can learn from, and collaborate with small data research, which offers data that is not contained in big data.</p>
<p>I started to think about my selfie studies. Specifically, I looked at 1) whether there are cultural differences between Chinese women&rsquo;s selfies on China&rsquo;s Weibo, and White Women&rsquo;s selfies on Twitter. For example, is it true that Chinese women focus on their face whereas White women focus on their body in their selfies? Do Chinese women&rsquo;s selfies show more cuteness?</p>
<p>I also looked at 2) whether there are gender differences between men&rsquo;s selfies and women&rsquo;s selfies. For example, do women show more self-touching in selfies?</p>
<p>I used a small-data approach. Although I downloaded over 30,000 images from Twitter and 8,000 images from Weibo, I only selected 200 from each platfrom for analysis, simply because I didn&rsquo;t have that much man power to analyze them all.</p>
<p>Talking about dig data and small data research, I think I can combine the two here. Human content analysis can offer some insights and then directions for bid data research. After all, there are so many things to detect in a selfie: the gender of the person, his or her mood, surroundings, posture, facial expressions, etc. Deep learning algorithms need some directions so that they can give us the analysis we need.</p>

<p>Thoughts: Professor Granovetter is right in pointing out that data itself might not help us have a deeper understanding of our society. After all, his seminal paper on &ldquo;weak ties&rdquo; is based on theoretical thinking rather than data.</p>
<p>What are most of the data in research papers used for? To test theories. But theories arise from thinking, not data. Data is limited. It&rsquo;s extremely difficult for most scholars to get high-quality large-scale data. That shouldn&rsquo;t become a barrier to theoretical advances. Scholars who cannot get access to quality data can focus on theoretical thinking.</p>

<p>Within the unstructured conition, there are more non-obese adopters than obese adopter, both in terms of number and percentage;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Across conditions: homophily boosted adoption among both the obese (<em>P</em> &lt; 0.01) and the non-obese people (<em>P</em> &lt; 0.05), using Mann-Whitney U test.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We can see that homophily had a significant effect on adoption of healthy behaviors. However, is it because obese people are more likely to be <strong>exposed</strong> to the behavior, or those who are exposed are morely likely to adopt these behaviors in a homophilous group?</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>It turns out that within both conditions, the relative percentage of the obese and the non-obese <strong>did not</strong> differ significantly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Across conditions: homophily boosted both the number and the fraction of the obese who were exposed to the behavior (<em>P</em> &lt; 0.05), using Mann-Whitney U test.. This happened despite that obese people initially had greater exposure in the unstructured networks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did homophily affect the adotion rate among those exposed? The effect was significant among the exposed obese people (<em>P</em> &lt; 0.01), using Mann-Whitney U test, but not among the exposed non-obese individuals.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note</strong> : Below are the notes on 2020-10-04</p>

<li>
<p>Motivation is also ordinary. Gold medalists did not think too far ahead. Instead, they focused on the most immediate goals, the so-called &ldquo;small wins&rdquo;. For example, Steve Lundquist, who won two gold medals in swimming in the Los Angeles Olympics, set a goal that he would win every single siwm in every single practice. <strong>Small wins added up to excellence and success</strong>.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t take what you do as too important. You should maintain mundanity. If you are going to deliever a commencement speech in front of an audience of thousands, you should know that almost nobody cares about nor remembers what you have to say.

<p>For both males and females, the cumulative distribution of the number of partners in the previous 12 months almost perfectly followed a straight line, indicating scale-free power-law characteristics;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For both genders, the cumulative distribution of the total number sexual partners in the entire lifetime followed a straight line only when <code>$k &gt; 20$</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The network of sexual partners is a scale-free one, meaning that you cannot assume, for example, 90% of the individuals have 3 - 10 partners. This is simply because there is no inherent scale. It&rsquo;s a crazy world, literally. I cannot believe that there are people who have over 100, even 1000 partners in their lifetime. Isn&rsquo;t this a crazy world?</p>

<p>Science news is usually quickly diffused. However, long-lasting interest doesn&rsquo;t correspond to the size of the interest. This means, even though people keep sharing it, not a lot of people will be interested in it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conspiracy rumors diffused slowly and its cascade size is positively correlated with its lifetime. Meaning that the longer it lasts, the more people become interested in it.</p>

<p>The work is indeed significant. It compared the spreading of true and false news on Twitter and concluded that the false spread faster, deeper, and farther than the truth. False political news, in particular, is diffused especially broadly and deeply.</p>
<ul>
<li>Was it because those who spread the false were more influential or active?</li>
</ul>
<p>Not really. Those who spread false news had fewer followers, followed fewer people on Twitter, are less likely to be verified, and had been on Twitter for less time.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Was it because false news was more noval and users are more likely to retweet information with more novelty?</p>
<ul>
<li>False rumors were indeed more novel than the truth;</li>
<li>False news was objectively more novel, but did users get it?
<ul>
<li>Yes, replies to false news showed greater surprise and disgust, whereas the truth inspired more sadness and joy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was it because of selection bias? I mean, the tweets from the six organizations might not be representative of all tweets.</p>
<ul>
<li>The authors verified a second sample of Tweets, which were labled by three undergraduates students as true, false, or mixed. Again, the results were the same.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did false news spread faster, deeper, farther, and more broadly because of bot activities? I mean, was it because bot crazily retweeted and replied to false news?</p>
<ul>
<li>Two bot-detection algorithms were applied independently to detect and remove bots before data analysis. Results were the same. This has significant implications: that false news travelled faster and farther not because of bots, but because of humans.</li>

<p>Why wasn&rsquo;t it published on <em>Nature</em> or <em>Science</em>: A first look at this paper made me feel that it should have published on <em>Nature</em> or <em>Science</em>. I believe the authors must have tried. After reading the whole paper, I concluded that lack of sufficient evidence might have been the reason why it didn&rsquo;t manage to do so. As the authors have mentioned in their limitations part, there were so many factors other than Twitter that influenced the movement in question, and it was impossible to single them out.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Increasing partisan preferences in the US created a context for fake news to attract huge audiences;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know the exact ratio of fake news against real news, and we don&rsquo;t know the medium-to-long-run effect of exposure to fake news on people&rsquo;s attitudes.</p>

<li>
<p>Bots on social media are hard to detect. Once a detecting technique is developed, bots will upgrate themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Possible interventions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Encouraging people to use fact checking. However, we are not sure whether this is useful or not, partyly due to people&rsquo;s confirmation bias and desirability bias.</li>
<li>Internet oligoplies should collaborate with academia to understand how pervasive fake news is. Also, these oligoplies&rsquo; power should be contained by, for example, legal systems.</li>

<p>Problems</p>
<ol>
<li>Interdisplinary research not encouraged enough, especially that involve cooperation between social and computer scientists, due to unfavorable policies at universities;</li>
<li>Proprietary data unavailable to researchers.</li>
<li>Available data is not intended for research and won&rsquo;t be shared with other researchers, which impedes reproducibility.</li>
<li>Lack of regulatory guidance from university IRBs about collectinga nd analyzing sensitive data.</li>

<p>Recommendations</p>
<ol>
<li>Collaborate and negotiate with private companies for data;</li>
<li>Build infrastructures that provide data as well as preserve participants&rsquo; privacy;</li>
<li>Develop new ethical guidelines;</li>
<li>Reorganize universities so that 1) multi-displinary collaboration is professionally or fanancially rewarded, and 2) enforce ethical research</li>
<li>Researchers make sure that they do public good.</li>

<li>Contribution: An experimental design that ran contrary to previous findings regarding the strength of weak ties.</li>
<li>Conclusion: networks with local clustering are conducive to behavioral diffusion.</li>
<li>Method: An experiment with two groups. One group found themselves in a random network, and the other group in a clustered-lattice network. <strong>Degree distribution of the two networks are identical</strong>.</li>
<li>Why could it be published on <em>Science</em>: Maybe the first empirical test of two competing hypotheses regarding the effect of network topology on behavior spreading.</li>
<li>My question: I didn&rsquo;t see many long ties in the &ldquo;small-world network&rdquo; in Figure 1.</li>
<li>Improvements: I didn&rsquo;t know all of the statistical tests used in this paper. I know Mann-Whitney U test but I don&rsquo;t know Kolmogorov-Smirnov. I am wondering whether the study could be conducted using Bayesian statistics.</li>
