<p>Many papers on the strength of weak ties do not answer the question of whether weak ties carry <strong>important</strong> or <strong>novel</strong> information.</p>
<p>To answer this question, we can test whether users pay more attention to information travelled through a weak tie. But how can we measure &ldquo;attention&rdquo;? A reasonable proxy is the number of friends a user has in a social network.</p>

<p>Four groups:</p>
<p>A control group in which participants had <strong>the same</strong> political ideology;</p>
<p>Group 2, 3, and 4 are all structured social networks with an equal number of conservatives and liberals. Group 2 were only shown the average of their 4 network neighbors, without any other information exhibited. Group 3 were shown the average of their neighbors plus the logos of political parties. Group 4 were shown the average as well, along with the neighbors political identity.</p>
<p>Each group provided estimates for three times. For the first round, each member estimated independently.</p>
<p>In Round 2 and Round 3, the control group revised their answers independently. Group 2 revised their answers while being exposed to their neighbors&rsquo; average answer. Group 3 revised their answer while bing exposed to Republican and Democratic party logo below their neighbors&rsquo; average estimate. Group 4 revised their response while bing were shown the usernames, political identification, and the average of each of their four neighbors, and the average of these four neighbors&rsquo; answers.</p>
<h3 id="results">Results<a href="#results" class="header-anchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"> # </a></h3>
<p>Group 2: both liberals and conservatives improved their trend accuracy, with an elimination of partisan bias in interpreting climate change data. Even conservatives in this group predicted trend significant more accurately than liberals in the control condition.</p>
<p>Group 3: there was no effect of social learning, and belief polarization in Round 1 was maintained.</p>
<p>Group 4: trend accuracy improved but moderate belief polarization remained.</p>
<p>(Belief polarization means that liberals significantly outperformed conservatives in predicting climate change trend.)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Exposure to logos of political parties had a stronger effect on decreasing the impact of social learning than exposure to neighbors&rsquo; political identity.</p>

<p>Can social learning reduce polarization in homogeneous networks (i.e., networks that not bipartisan)? Robustness tests showed that <strong>the effect of social learning was reduced in politically homogeneous networks</strong>: by Round 3, trend accuracy of conservatives in these echo chambers did not differ significantly from conservatives in the control condition.</p>
<p><div class="reminder">
Considering this result, instead of saying the effec of social learning was <strong>reduced</strong>, I think it&rsquo;s more accurate to say it was <strong>removed</strong>.
</div></p>
<p>Another question is whether the effect of social learning remains if participants in Group 4 were shown individual answers rather than an average. Results showed that the effect of social learning was robust to exposure to individual responses.</p>
<p><div class="reminder">
I am very puzzled by the result. It showed that the effect of social learning was eliminated in homogeneous networks, but the paper of <em>the wisdom of partisan crowds</em> showed exactly <a href="/en/apad/#2020-11-16-edited-on-2020-11-19-and-2020-11-20">the opposite result</a>

<li>Complex contagions require a critical mass to start a large-scale cascade and critical mass is dependent on network topology, nodes degree distribution, and adoption thresholds.</li>

<p>Thresholds of contagions vary. Different people and different activities may have different thresholds.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Homophily and diversity in diffusion</li>
</ol>
<p>Identity-based diversity means one&rsquo;s neighbors have different characteristics. Structural diversity means one&rsquo;s neighbors belong to different components of the network. The first kind of diversity <strong>reduces</strong> the spreading of complex contagions whereas the second one <strong>amplifies</strong> it.</p>
<p>If one has too many friends, he or she might not be an ideal target of complex contagions. This is because complex contagions need multiple reinforcement. When you have too many friends, you receive fewer repeated exposure. Therefore, &ldquo;clustered, homophilous networks&rdquo; are conducive to complex contagions.</p>

<p>Conclusion: Homogeneous networks do not necessarily lead to polarization. In fact, polarization is decreased and accuracy increased.</p>
<p>Then why do we still have polarized public opinions? This is because popular social media are centralized networks, which make influencers able to exert disproportional effects on other people in the network.</p>

<p>Results of Experiment 1: Information exchange in homogeneous networks increased accuracy for both party memebers and decreased belief polarization.</p>
<p>Individual learning (being able to edit their answers in Round 2 and 3) was not the reason for increased accuracy because <strong>the decrease in truth-centered mean (absolute distance from the mean) in the social group was significantly larger than that in the control group</strong>. Therefore, the change should be attributed to information from others.</p>
<p>Another possible reason is that the increased accuracy for groups as a whole obscured the decreased accuracy at an individual level, for example, when the standard deviation of truth-centered mean in a group increased. Results showed that for social groups, the standard deviation of responses in Round 3 was significantly smaller than that in Round 1. This change did not occur in the control group, indicating that <strong>similarity within social groups increased</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Replication study design</strong> has some differences than Experiment 1:</p>
<ol>
<li>More controversial questions;</li>
<li>Participants were required to confirm their political preference before participating in the study;</li>
<li>The experiment interface included an image of an elephant and a donkey;</li>
<li>The answer from four other connected participants were accompanied by their political orientation;</li>
<li>Subjects knew that they were participating in a study related to &ldquo;Politics Challenge&rdquo;.</li>
</ol>
<p>Items 2 - 5 were partisan primes intended to &ldquo;enhance the effects of partisan bias on social information processing&rdquo; (p. 4).</p>
<p>Results of the replication study: same as in Experiment 1, social learning increased participants&rsquo; answer accuracy for both Democrats and Republicans. Participants within each group became more similar over time.</p>
<p>So,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; social learning is robust to partisan priming for both group-level improvement and individual improvement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But how about the difference between Democrats and Republicans? The above results showed &ldquo;within group&rdquo; changes but not between group changes. Results showed that between-group similarity also increased for participants in the social condition (37% for Experiment 1 and 46% for the replication study), which means that polarization decreased.</p>
<p><strong>To recap</strong>: social information exchange within homogeneous networks helped people make more accurate estimates. Similarity within and between groups increased, indicating that people within social groups got similar, and that polarization diminished. And this result withstood partisan priming.</p>
<p>My question: Will the result stay the same if information exchange is not confined to numeric estimates? Why don&rsquo;t we allow people to chat? Is it because of lack of technical support or that there is theoretical consideration against it?</p>

<p><strong>Experiment design</strong>:</p>
<p>Participants were randomly assigned to two conditions: control condition vs social condition. They were asked to provide an answer to a question for three times (rounds):</p>

In Round 2, they were shown the average answer of four other participants connected to them in a social network and then updated their answer. In Round 3, they were shown the average of the updated answers of four other participants connected to them (same in Round 2) and provided a final answer to the question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A network consists of 35 participants who shared the same political orientation (either Democrats or Republicans). Participants in the network <strong>did not</strong> know that other people in the network had the same partisan preference as theirs.</p>

<p>Even without digital tools to communicate with each other, rebel activities became more widespread in Syria. This is surprising because without telecommunication, Syrian rebels lost long ties that bridge groups far away from each other. That is, they had to rely on face-to-face communication to coordinate. How did it happen? When you get to understand that the way behaviors spread is different from that information diffuses, the answer will become clearer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information, messages, and ideas spread like epidemic whereas human behaviors don&rsquo;t. Contagions can be classified into two types: simple and complex. A single contact can start a simple contagion, but won&rsquo;t do the same for complex contagions, which involve efforts and costs, and require confirmation or reinforcement from multiple sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Long ties are enough for simple contagions whereas complex contagions favor wide ties. How wide should a tie be for a behavior to spread varies. If reputation is at stake, the threshold will be higher. That&rsquo;s where complex contagions are very different from simple ones. In simple contagions, hubs get infected early and then it spreads the infections to many others. In a complex contagion, however, hubs usually have reputation at stake, so they are less, rather than more, likely to get infected.</p>

<p>&hellip; allowing smokers and nonsmokers to exchange views while aware of each other&rsquo;s smoking status effectively reduced bias both in their evaluation of health risks, and in their beliefs about each other&rsquo;s capacity to accurately interpret scientific data about the health risks of tabaco use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An interesting finding in this study is that after interacting with each other in social networks (which was limited to numeric estimates in the study), smokers and nonsmokers did not differ significantly in their perceptions of smokers&rsquo; ability to understand health information associated with smoking. This means that biases were reduced.</p>

<p>Study design:</p>
<p>1,600 people were recruited via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. There are 10 independent trials in the experiment. Each trial involves 160 participants who were randomly assigned to the following three groups:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Control group: 40 smokers / 40 non-smokers, so 80 people in each trail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anonymous network group: 40 people (20 smokers and 20 nonsmokers) were embedded into a random social network that is decentralized and anonymous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Informative network group: 40 people (20 smokers and 20 nonsmokers) were put into a social network where they could see the usernames and the smoking status of their four network neighbors.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Procedure:</p>
<p>Participants were shown an <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0227813.g002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anti-smoking advertisement</a>

 and were asked to estimate the health risk of smoking by answering this question: How many people (in millions) are predicted to die from tobacco use in developed countries, in 2030?</p>
<p>Participants were incentivized by monetary reward awarded based on the accuracy of their final answer. Changes in answers&rsquo; accuracy were measured by the difference between Round 1 and Round 3.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Round 1: Participants in all group provided the answer independently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Round 2: Group 1 revised their estimates with independent reflection. Group 2 were shown the average response of their contacts and then revised their estimates. Group 3 were also shown the average response by their four contacts. They were also shown the usernames and the smoking status of their contacts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Round 3: Same as in Round 2.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Results:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Round 1, both smokers and nonsmokers were equaly inaccurate at estimating the health risk of smoking;</li>
<li>No significant improvement in estimate accuracy in the control group.</li>
<li>The decrease in estimate error in group 2 was significantly greater than both smoker and nonsmokers in the control group;</li>
<li>The decrease in estimate error in group 3 was significantly greater than group 2. Specifically, this decrease is ten times greater than both smoker and nonsmoker in the control group.</li>

<p>Social media of our time exacerbates rather than eradicates partisan bias, because it&rsquo;s centralized, rather than egalitarian. In a centralized network, influencers filter or even block information. For example, if an influencer spreads a piece of wrong information, it might end up becoming an entrenched false belief in the whole community. In contract, in an egalitarian network, each person has an equal say, and ideas are weighed by its own quality rather than the influence of the people behind them.</p>

<p>In a more complete analysis, the multiverse of data sets could be crossed with the multiverse of models to further reveal the multiverse of statistical results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is so true. I have several thoughts about this point:</p>
<p>First, it shows how arbitrary the choices in data processing and model picking are, and therefore, how arbitrary the statistical results might be. When I was doing research on selfie, I also had the same feeling. When I was doing the content analysis study comparing the differences in White women&rsquo;s selfies on Twitter and Chinese women&rsquo;s selfies on Weibo, I had to made so many arbitrary choices: whether to drop an item from a construct, whether to combine items, should I use a <em>t</em> test or nonparametric test, etc.</p>
<p>Second, doing multiverse analysis reporting is very methodologically challenging. I cannot imagine a Master student after attending one statistics class doing a project involving more than 200 choice combinations.</p>
<p>Finally, scholars will find it more difficult to cite others&rsquo; studies. Right now, it&rsquo;s fairly easy to cite because almost all research papers generate a <strong>certain</strong> result. With multiverse analysis, almost all studies will involve many <strong>uncertainties</strong>. This complicates how people interpret the statistical results.</p>
<p>That said, statistics is about <strong>uncertainties</strong>. It&rsquo;s certainly good to show these <strong>uncertainties</strong>. I think the science community, and the public, should be accustomed to seeing <strong>uncertainties</strong> in statistical results in the coming years.</p>

<p>Increasing transparency in reporting through a multiverse analysis is valuable, regardless of the inferential framework (frequentist or Bayesian), and regardless of the specific way uncertainty is quantified: a <em>p</em> value, an effect size, a confidence (Cumming, 2013) or credibility (Kruschke, 2010) interval, or a Bayes Factor (Morey &amp; Rouder, 2011).</p>

<p>The authors argued that &ldquo;preregistration or blind analysis are not useful strategies for deflating the multiverse&rdquo; (p. 709). I totally agree. I am not familiar with blind analysis, so I&rsquo;ll just talk about preregistration. As the authors noted, even the study is preregistered, the result is still just one of the many possible choice combinations, albeit preregistered made. Therefore, the results of a preregistered study are still arbitrary, if the research involves arbitrary, or &ldquo;whimsical&rdquo; choices in data construction.</p>

<li>Why are two (separate) control conditions needed? Because the percentage (46.8%) of posts containing at least one positive word is much larger than that (22.4%) of posts containing at least one negative word. Suppose that for a person, 10% of his <strong>positive</strong> News Feed is omitted, and there is only <strong>one</strong> control group, what should be the corresponding percentage of a person&rsquo;s <strong>random</strong> News Feed being omitted in this control group? I don&rsquo;t know. Why? For example, if there are three people in experiment A (positivity reduction group), and their content reduction rate is 12%, 13%, and 14% respectively. Accordingly, we assume that the content reduction rate in the control group should be 12% times 46.8%, 13% times 46.8%, and 14% times 46.8%.  <strong>No</strong>. Why? Because there is also experiment B, whose content reduction rate might be different that that of experiment A. <strong>Therefore, each experiment needs a separate control condition</strong>.</li>

<p>Correlational studies cannot answer this question since it cannot support causality. Controlled experiments can support causality, but they have these problems:</p>

<li>Exposure is not equal to interaction. In a controlled experiment, mood change might come from interacting with a happy/sad person, rather than simply being exposed to that person&rsquo;s mood;</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Barriers to women in science remain widely spread worldwide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Main takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the most productive countries, papers with women in dominant author positions, i.e., sole author, first author, and last author, are cited less than those with men in the same positions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>South America and Eastern Europe had greater gender parity in terms of proportion of authorships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disciplines dominated by women all have to do with &ldquo;care&rdquo;, for example, nursing; speech, language, and hearing; education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Natural sciences and humanities are dominated by men. Social sciences had a higher proportion of female authors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Female collaborations are more domestically oriented than are the collaborations of males from the same country&rdquo;  (p. 213)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My issue: How did the authors assign gender to each author? It seems to me a very daunting task, especially when the names are of a non-Western origin.</p>

<p>Major takeaway: Big data research can learn from, and collaborate with small data research, which offers data that is not contained in big data.</p>
<p>I started to think about my selfie studies. Specifically, I looked at 1) whether there are cultural differences between Chinese women&rsquo;s selfies on China&rsquo;s Weibo, and White Women&rsquo;s selfies on Twitter. For example, is it true that Chinese women focus on their face whereas White women focus on their body in their selfies? Do Chinese women&rsquo;s selfies show more cuteness?</p>
<p>I also looked at 2) whether there are gender differences between men&rsquo;s selfies and women&rsquo;s selfies. For example, do women show more self-touching in selfies?</p>
<p>I used a small-data approach. Although I downloaded over 30,000 images from Twitter and 8,000 images from Weibo, I only selected 200 from each platform for analysis, simply because I didn&rsquo;t have that much man power to analyze them all.</p>
<p>Talking about dig data and small data research, I think I can combine the two here. Human content analysis can offer some insights and then directions for bid data research. After all, there are so many things to detect in a selfie: the gender of the person, his or her mood, surroundings, posture, facial expressions, etc. Deep learning algorithms need some directions so that they can give us the analysis we need.</p>

<p>Thoughts: Professor Granovetter is right in pointing out that data itself might not help us have a deeper understanding of our society. After all, his seminal paper on &ldquo;weak ties&rdquo; is based on theoretical thinking rather than data.</p>
<p>What are most of the data in research papers used for? To test theories. But theories arise from thinking, not data. Data is limited. It&rsquo;s extremely difficult for most scholars to get high-quality large-scale data. That shouldn&rsquo;t become a barrier to theoretical advances. Scholars who cannot get access to quality data can focus on theoretical thinking.</p>

<p>Homophily is defined as &ldquo;the tendency of social contacts to be similar to one another&rdquo;. Although research on diffusion, and that on social influence differ over the effects of homophily on behavior spreading at the dyadic level, both agree that homophily decreases adoption at the network level. This is because, obviously, the more homophilous one&rsquo;s network is, he is she is less likely to be exposed to individuals of a different characteristic. If you are a less healthy person, and you find yourself in a homophilous network, it&rsquo;s less likely for you to be aware of what those healthy guys are doing.</p>
<h3 id="purpose">Purpose<a href="#purpose" class="header-anchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"> # </a></h3>
<p>To study the effect of homophily on the adoption of healthy behavior</p>
<h3 id="design">Design<a href="#design" class="header-anchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"> # </a></h3>
<p>710 participants are randomly put into two conditions: homophilous population condition, and unconstructed population condition. Homophilous population condition consists of people having similar individual characteristics (gender, age, and BMI) whereas people in the other condition are random and mixed.</p>
<p>All networks in the study have the same size (= 72), clustering coefficient (= 0.4), and degree distribution (= 6). The only differece is the level of homophily.</p>
<p>The study consisted of five trials, each having two social networks. All these trials ran at the same time, for seven weeks. The healthy behavior to be adopted is to write diet diary online.</p>
<p>The seed of the behavior in all networks is a &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; individual. At the start of Week 1, the author activated the seed nodes simultaneously. Once an individual signs up, their neighbors will be notified via email.</p>
<h3 id="results-2">Results<a href="#results-2" class="header-anchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"> # </a></h3>
<p>Across all five trials, people in homophilous condition had a higher adoption rate than those in unconstructed condition.</p>
<p>Comparing adoption among obese and nonobese individuals: Within homophilous condition, a greater percentage of obese individuals adopted the behavior than that of nonobese people. In unconstructed condition, both the number of and percentage of nonobese adopters were larger than obese adopters. In fact, there was <strong>no</strong> obese adopters in the unconstructed group at all.</p>
<p>Comparing the two conditions: homophily increased the adoption among both the obese and nonobese people.</p>
<p>However, from these results, we cannot say for sure that <strong>homophily</strong> is the reason. For example, it may be that in the homophilous condition, obese people have more neighbors who sign up and thus have more exposure. It may also because that homophily increases the likelihood for people to sign up once they are exposed. Therefore, we need to compare 1.) <strong>exposure</strong>, and 2.) <strong>the likelihood to adopt once exposed</strong> in the two conditions.</p>
<p>It showed that, <strong>within each of the two conditions</strong>, the percentage of exposed obese people (num. of exposed obese / total num. of obese ppl) and that of exposed nonobese people (num. of exposed nonobese / total num. of nonobese ppl) do not differ significantly. <strong>Across conditions</strong>, homophily significantly increased the percentage of exposed obese people. See Fig. 2D.</p>
<p>How about the liklihood? <strong>within conditions</strong>, the likelihood to adopt after exposure was much higher for the obesed than for the nonobesed. <strong>Acorss conditions</strong>, homophily significantly increased obese people&rsquo;s likelihood to adopt after exposure.</p>
<p>Therefore, homophily increased obese people&rsquo;s <strong>access</strong> to, and the <strong>likelihood</strong> to adopt, health behavior.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; low adoption levels of health innovations among less healthy individuals may be a function of social environment rather than a baseline reluctance for adoption.</p>

<p>Major takeaways from this paper:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Information on social media quickly reaches in 2 hours around 20% of the people it can reach in the end, and reach in 5 hours around 40%. This is true for both science and rumors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Science news is usually quickly diffused. However, long-lasting interest doesn&rsquo;t correspond to the size of the interest. This means, even though people keep sharing it, not a lot of people will be interested in it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conspiracy rumors diffused slowly and its cascade size is positively correlated with its lifetime. Meaning that the longer it lasts, the more people become interested in it.</p>

<p>The work is indeed significant. It compared the spreading of true and false news on Twitter and concluded that the false spread faster, deeper, and farther than the truth. False political news, in particular, is diffused especially broadly and deeply.</p>
<ul>
<li>Was it because those who spread the false were more influential or active?</li>
</ul>
<p>Not really. Those who spread false news had fewer followers, followed fewer people on Twitter, are less likely to be verified, and had been on Twitter for less time.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Was it because false news was more noval and users are more likely to retweet information with more novelty?</p>
<ul>
<li>False rumors were indeed more novel than the truth;</li>
<li>False news was objectively more novel, but did users get it?
<ul>
<li>Yes, replies to false news showed greater surprise and disgust, whereas the truth inspired more sadness and joy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was it because of selection bias? I mean, the tweets from the six organizations might not be representative of all tweets.</p>
<ul>
<li>The authors verified a second sample of Tweets, which were labeled by three undergraduates students as true, false, or mixed. Again, the results were the same.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did false news spread faster, deeper, farther, and more broadly because of bot activities? I mean, was it because bot crazily retweeted and replied to false news?</p>
<ul>
<li>Two bot-detection algorithms were applied independently to detect and remove bots before data analysis. Results were the same. This has significant implications: that false news traveled faster and farther not because of bots, but because of humans.</li>

<p>Why wasn&rsquo;t it published on <em>Nature</em> or <em>Science</em>: A first look at this paper made me feel that it should have published on <em>Nature</em> or <em>Science</em>. I believe the authors must have tried. After reading the whole paper, I concluded that lack of sufficient evidence might have been the reason why it didn&rsquo;t manage to do so. As the authors have mentioned in their limitations part, there were so many factors other than Twitter that influenced the movement in question, and it was impossible to single them out.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Increasing partisan preferences in the US created a context for fake news to attract huge audiences;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know the exact ratio of fake news against real news, and we don&rsquo;t know the medium-to-long-run effect of exposure to fake news on people&rsquo;s attitudes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bots on social media are hard to detect. Once a detecting technique is developed, bots will upgrade themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Possible interventions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Encouraging people to use fact checking. However, we are not sure whether this is useful or not, partly due to people&rsquo;s confirmation bias and desirability bias.</li>
<li>Internet oligopolies should collaborate with academia to understand how pervasive fake news is. Also, these oligopolies&rsquo; power should be contained by, for example, legal systems.</li>

<p>Problems</p>
<ol>
<li>Interdisciplinary research not encouraged enough, especially that involve cooperation between social and computer scientists, due to unfavorable policies at universities;</li>
<li>Proprietary data unavailable to researchers.</li>
<li>Available data is not intended for research and won&rsquo;t be shared with other researchers, which impedes reproducibility.</li>
<li>Lack of regulatory guidance from university IRBs about collecting nd analyzing sensitive data.</li>

<p>Recommendations</p>
<ol>
<li>Collaborate and negotiate with private companies for data;</li>
<li>Build infrastructures that provide data as well as preserve participants&rsquo; privacy;</li>
<li>Develop new ethical guidelines;</li>
<li>Reorganize universities so that 1) multi-disciplinary collaboration is professionally or financially rewarded, and 2) enforce ethical research</li>
<li>Researchers make sure that they do public good.</li>

<li>Contribution: An experimental design that ran contrary to previous findings regarding the strength of weak ties.</li>
<li>Conclusion: networks with local clustering are conducive to behavioral diffusion.</li>
<li>Method: An experiment with two groups. One group found themselves in a random network, and the other group in a clustered-lattice network. <strong>Degree distribution of the two networks is identical</strong>.</li>
<li>Why could it be published on <em>Science</em>: Maybe the first empirical test of two competing hypotheses regarding the effect of network topology on behavior spreading.</li>
<li>My question: I didn&rsquo;t see many long ties in the &ldquo;small-world network&rdquo; in Figure 1.</li>
<li>Improvements: I didn&rsquo;t know all of the statistical tests used in this paper. I know Mann-Whitney U test but I don&rsquo;t know Kolmogorov-Smirnov. I am wondering whether the study could be conducted using Bayesian statistics.</li>
