      <description>How can I print a directory tree like this on Mac:
|____Folder_2 |____YourBlogdownProj.RProj |____Static | |____Data | | |____YourData.csv |____Folder_1 Open a new Terminal. Type this
open ~/.bash_profile -a TextEdit If you prefer Sublime Text, you can replace TextEdit with &amp;quot;Sublime Text&amp;quot;.
Then, simply add the following on a new line:
alias tree=&amp;#34;find . -print | sed -e &amp;#39;s;[^/]*/;|____;g;s;____|; |;g&amp;#39;&amp;#34; Save the change. Open a new Terminal using Command + N, cd to the folder of which you want to print a directory tree, and simply type tree in your Terminal.</description>

      <title>Continous Local Preview in Blogdown</title>

      <description>Yihui talked about local preview in Blogdown here and here , but they were not very straightforward.
How to do it then?
Basically, you only need to Serve Site once. In the drop list of Addins, choose Serve Site. Later, when you make changes in your .Rmd files, you just need to save the changes by Command + S (in Mac) or clicking the Save button in Rstudio. These changes will be updated automatically.</description>

      <description>Yihui documented figure referencing very well. There is only one thing I need to add: do remember to add a figure caption if you want to reference it.
For example, if we have a chunk label without a figure caption:
plot(pressure) We cannot reference it: Figure ??.
This is because without a figure caption, the figure won’t be numbered. Without a number, the figure cannot be referenced.
Simply adding a figure caption solves the problem:</description>

      <description>After clicking &amp;ldquo;Buy Now&amp;rdquo;, you&amp;rsquo;ll see in &amp;ldquo;Total&amp;rdquo; that the price is much higher than it should be. This is because Amazon chooses the default shipping method which charges around $8 even though the stuff you are purchasing should include free shipping.
What should we do then?
Click the first row which says &amp;ldquo;Arriving &amp;hellip;&amp;quot;, and from there, choose &amp;ldquo;FREE Shipping&amp;rdquo;.
Lesson learned: Never be deceiful as Amazon.</description>

      <description>To configure a custom subdomain for Netlify (for example, to point legacy-jupyterbook.hongtaoh.com to legacy-jupyterbook.netlify.app) should be very easy, but the instructions on Netlify can be a little confusing, even misleading.
  The confusing instruction   The most confusing point is shown above. It asks you to add a custom domain in the format of www.yourdomain.com. However, that is for configuring a custom domain, not a custom subdomain. Then, what should you do?</description>

      <description>Rmarkdown and Bookdown are highly reliant on Pandoc. Sometimes, issues may happen when Rstudio is using an older version of Pandoc even if you have downloaded the newest version, as was discussed here .
Yihui&amp;rsquo;s Solution Yihui provided a solution : to put the newest version of pandoc into /usr/local/bin. How to do it?
First of all, you need to install the updated version of Pandoc you want. Remember the path where it is installed.</description>

      <description>CuteStat can be really annoying. When I first built my website, and searched my name in Google, mydomain.cutestat.com appeared on top of the resarch restults and it was so ugly!
How can we block CuteStat from crawliing our websites?
A direct way to do this is to go to the bottom of CuteStat , and open Update or Remove .
CuteStat asked us to add a robots.txt file in our website with the following codes:</description>

      <description>The default of Hugo is that when you open a link in a page rendered by markdown, you&amp;rsquo;ll stay in the current tab. How can we enable openning a new tab then?
The answer was provided by PrasdPen .
Go to layouts/_default, create a new folder and name it as _markup. Then add a render-link.html with the following code:
&amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;{{ .Destination | safeURL }}&amp;#34;{{ with .Title}} title=&amp;#34;{{ . }}&amp;#34;{{ end }}{{ if strings.</description>

      <description>I saw this quesiton on this thread but the answer by bep did not solve the problem.
The solution can be found in Yihui Xie&amp;rsquo;s book of Blogdown .
However, when I tried the block of codes recommended by Yihui, I still couldn&amp;rsquo;t implement this function of editing on GitHub:
{{ with .File.Path }} &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://github.com/.../{{ . }}&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Edit this page&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; {{ end }} I tried the second block of codes on Yihui&amp;rsquo;s book, and it works.</description>

      <description>Changing Folder/File Name If you are too lazy to change the folder or file name manually, you can do that in Terminal. What you need to do is first to go to a the direction the folder/file is located in. For example, if you are changing the name of a folder on your Desktop, then you need to cd Destkop first. Then:
mv oldfoldername newfoldername The same is for when you are changing a file&amp;rsquo;s name.</description>

      <description>Earlier, I thought this must be a difficult undertaking, but later I found this is relatively easy to accomplish.
The solution was here , posted by funkydan2.
According to Hugo&amp;rsquo;s documentation on Page Variables , there are two ways to specify last modification date. One way is to specify the .Lastmod in a content&amp;rsquo;s front matter. That is to say, while you are specifying the title, date, author, slug, etc., you also specify lastmod.</description>

Maybe there is an easy way to transfer, but it is beyong my ability now (I guess it&amp;rsquo;s complicated so I didn&amp;rsquo;t even bother searching for an answer).
So I git clone the repo from my old account and tried to push it to my new account.</description>

When installed, Homebrew takes up over 400MB. That&amp;rsquo;s a lot of space, at least for me.
I installed Homebrew and then I wanted to delete it. So I went to /usr/local/bin/. I was lost. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t know which files to delete. Since /usr/local/bin/ is a hidden folder in Mac, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to mess up with it.</description>

Many people really like TED talks. These talks were and possibly still are very popular among Chinese students who regard TED talks as a valuable resource to learn English. In this aspect, I agree. TED is very helpful for English learners like me1. After all, most of the speakers are native speakers and their talks are very good for learners to practice listening and speaking.</description>

Experts envision that things in the future would be interconnected and freely share information with each other. For example, a car, through sensors, would be connected with tunnels and bridges it passes through and all other vehicles. Based on IoT technology and big data, an intelligent transportation system (ITS) could be built which promotes safety, efficiency, and conveniences1.</description>
